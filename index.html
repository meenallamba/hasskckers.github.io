    <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">An era when women are increasingly prominent in medicine, law, and
      business, why are there so few women scientists and engineers?</p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">A 2010 research report by AAUW presents compelling evidence that
      can help to explain this puzzle. 
      Why So Few? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) presents in-depth 
      yet accessible profiles of eight key research findings that point to environmental 
      and social barriers — including stereotypes, gender bias, and the climate of science 
      and engineering departments in colleges and universities — that continue to block women’s 
      progress in STEM. The report also includes statistics on girls’ and women’s achievement 
      and participation in these areas and offers new ideas for what each of us can do to 
      more fully open scientific and engineering fields to girls and women.     
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution
        to declare February 11th as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. This effort to help break 
        down barriers in STEM fields for women is focused on empowering young girls as they accesses information and
        pursue opportunities within the sciences.</p>
                                                                                                   

      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">According to UNESCO, only 35% of all female students are enrolled
      in STEM-related fields in higher education, and just under 29% of researchers worldwide are women.</p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">Gender equality in educational and professional opportunities, 
      pay, and recognition is key to creating a world where the science that impacts our everyday lives, and futures,
      is inclusive and beneficial to everyone. From climate change research to the next
      major development in AI, women contributing to diverse scientific fields brings 
      fresh perspectives that can lead to big breakthroughs!
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">Getting more women interested in tech is no idealistic matter. 
        This is needed. In 10 years, IT will be more important than ever, our society, health, safety and economy 
        will depend on it. Their benefits in businesses; companies with women on the team have higher valuations. 
        According to the researchers of Spain, gender diverse teams lead to greater creativity and better decisions.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">I find it very unfortunate, that there are so few women in the IT
        market, also because we know that our customers want more women in their projects. It makes better and more 
        balanced teams.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">Luckily, today, many successful women are already present in the 
       IT world and can function as role models for the women of tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to reach a better balance 
        in both education and with regards to tech jobs when looking at the number of men and women who choose to 
        study and work in technology and IT. Through a lot of small and big actions, the system and the culture can 
        and must be changed. This is not only in the interest of the women, it is also almost a prerequisite if we 
        want to accommodate the growing demand for skilled IT specialists.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">Are Women Simply Not Designed for STEM?</p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">Biologically, there are differences between male and female 
        brains. Boys are better at special tasks. Girls, however, excel at verbal recall tasks. This is frequently 
        an argument to state that women aren’t biologically designed for STEM.

      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">However, scientifically, this difference isn’t large and its effect
        on female aptitude to STEM is minuscule. Thus, the biological differences alone do not provide enough proof 
        and explanation for the lack of women in STEM.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">There are plenty of famous women in STEM who prove that they are 
        equally as capable as men. Moreover, countries with less gender equality curiously have more women in STEM. 
        You’d expect the opposite trend to prevail.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 64px; color: #003495">The data clearly indicates that something about the way we 
        approach this issue isn’t working. To fix something that isn’t working, we need to find out why it’s broken 
        in the first place.
